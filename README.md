## General Information
In this project, I set out to develop a custom object detection model using the YOLOv5 architecture. My goal was to train the model on a dataset of my choice containing multiple objects and to evaluate its performance on a test set of images and videos.

I trained the custom object detection model using the YOLOv5 architecture, experimenting with various hyperparameters and training techniques to optimize its performance. I also employed transfer learning by pretraining the model on a large-scale dataset to improve its generalization capabilities. After training, I evaluated the model's accuracy and speed on a separate test set of images and videos. 

To demonstrate the model's effectiveness, I appplied it to some real-world use cases, such as detecting different types of apples.
